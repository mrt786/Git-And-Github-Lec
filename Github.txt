Repo = Repository

to link your Github repo to the git repo use this command:
    git remote nickName to the github repo. Conventially we call this as origin

    second we have to give the url of the github repo
    
    git remote add origin "Link to the github repo which will be in the form of https"
    
    to check that whether it is linked or not use this command:
    
    git remote
    
    git remote -v it will give you more details

    to remove this we use 
    git remote remove nickNameYouHaveGiven
    Push and Pull push means uploading on github and

    git config --global cardinential.username "add your github username here"

    git push nickName and which branch of the commits you want to push i.e master
    git push origin master

    if the repo is newly created:
        git branch -M main
        git remote add origin repoLink
        git push -u origin main

    if not then:
        git remote add origin repLink
        git branch -M main
        git push -u origin main


    If some issues occur then use the personal token access:
        go to the github settings and then got to the developer setting . Click on the personal access tokens then generate a new token
        check the repo in the select scopes section
        save this token to a place as it would not be appear after that 
        and use this instead of passowrds

    To check the remote tracking branch:
        git log --all --graph it will show you like this (HEAD, origin(i.e nickName)/master, master)
        first add the commit into the version history

    If you want to add more commits:
        git push orgin master (it only pushes the commits if donot pushes the changes)
        if the terminal says everything is upto date, you've updated to the latest
        git push orgin master --set-upstream
        after the above command simply write this command 
        git push

    This command will do the branching off:
        this will overroad this existing commit
        git commit --amend -m "V12"
        it is a bad practice and it will be allowed using this command
        git remote add origin repLink -f

    From Github to Computer:
        git clone linkToRemoteRepository folderName
        if you donot give the folder name, it will exactly download with the same folderName
